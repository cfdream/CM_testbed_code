method1
Each switch calculate fn by itself. If one target flow is captured by switch1 && target flow signal stored at switch1, it is not a FN.
method2
all switches as a whole. If a target flow is captured by switch1 && target flow signal stored at switch1, it is not a FN. 
method3
all switches as a whole. 
It is a right catch if a target flow is captured by any switch
method 4
It is a right catch if a target flow is captured by all the switches
